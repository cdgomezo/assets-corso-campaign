# Figures: Preparing for an extensive $\Delta^{14}\text{CO}_2$ flask sample monitoring campaign over Europe to constrain fossil $\text{CO}_2$ emissions

Abstract: During 2024, an intensive $\chem{\Delta^{14}\text{CO}_2}$ flask sampling campaign is being conducted at 12 sampling stations across Europe as part of the CO2MVS Research on Supplementary Observations (CORSO) project. These $\chem{\Delta^{14}\text{CO}_2}$ samples, combined with $\chem{\text{CO}_2}$ atmospheric measurements, are intended to enhance the estimation of fossil $\chem{\text{CO}_2}$ emissions over Europe through inverse modeling. In this study, we perform a series of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to evaluate the added value of such an intensive campaign as well as the different sampling strategies in estimating fossil fuel emissions. These strategies focus on selecting samples for inversions based on their fossil $\chem{\text{CO}_2}$ and nuclear $\chem{^{14}\text{C}}$ composition.

We explore three main sampling strategies: (1) a base case scenario using a uniform sampling approach without specific selection criteria, comparing current sampling methods with the inclusion of flask samples; (2) a strategy that selects samples with high fossil $\chem{\text{CO}_2}$ contribution; and (3) a combined approach that also considers nuclear $\chem{^{14}\text{C}}$ contamination to reduce potential biases from nuclear facilities. In the first strategy, the results suggest that higher sampling density can improve the estimation of fossil $\chem{\text{CO}_2}$ emissions, particularly during periods of low fossil fuel activity, such as in summer. This increase in sample quantity contributes to a reduction in uncertainty, enhancing the robustness of inverse modeling results. Furthermore, applying the strategy of selecting samples with high fossil $\chem{\text{CO}_2}$ contamination shows potential for improving the accuracy of emission estimates. However, the most significant reduction in uncertainty is observed when the sampling strategy also accounts for nuclear $\chem{^{14}\text{C}}$ contamination. By considering nuclear emissions, this combined strategy helps to minimize potential biases, particularly in regions with high nuclear activity, such as France and the UK. The findings underscore the importance of not only increasing sample frequency but also carefully selecting samples based on their fossil and nuclear $\chem{\text{CO}_2}$ composition to improve the reliability of fossil fuel emission estimates across Europe.
